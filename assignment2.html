        <h2>The situation</h2>
        <p>
          One of your clients requested a task that would need development.
          You opened a task to the development team, and they gave you a due date
          in 15 days from the request. You have informed your client regarding the due date,
          and they agreed on it. After 15 days, the development team informed you
          that they had a pretty busy schedule and would not deliver the task on time.
          You have sent an email to your client with a new due date 7 days after today.<br><br>
          You have received the email below. Please prepare a response to the client.

          <h2>Client's email regarding the delay</h2>
          <p>
            Hello,<br><br>
            Today is the due date of our personalization to be prepared. As I understand,
            the campaign will be ready after seven days.<br><br>
            Next week is an important time for us to launch our new arrivals for the spring season.
            We have finished all the social media posts, ads, and website updates.
            As you know, we were planning to use your templates to highlight our new arrivals.
            Why haven’t you informed me so far?<br><br>
            This situation is unacceptable. I request a solution to this problem by tomorrow evening.<br><br>
            If you can’t provide a solution, I will get support from other vendors we work with,
            and there will be no need for the related task or any other tasks in the future.<br><br>
            Best,
          </p>

        <h2>The response regarding the matter</h2>
        <p>Hello, <br><br>

          Thank you for your response on the matter!<br><br>

          First of all, I apologize for the delay in deployment for your personalization.
           However, our development team is working at their full capacity in order
           to improve the performance of the product. This will be beneficial to
           enhance customer’s experience when connecting to the store, furthermore
           increasing customer’s satisfaction with the product. It would also be
           beneficial for any forthcoming development.<br><br>

          Therefore, please allow our development team a little extra time to work on the request.
          I will ensure to do everything in my power to have the deployment ready for your new season
          collection release by the end of the week, and as soon as the deployment is ready,
          I will inform you immediately.<br><br>

          Thank you for your patience,<br>
          Huy Kieu
